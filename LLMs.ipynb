    "| Key | Type | Value |\n",

    "| messages | List | This is a list that contains the messages intended for the video generation. Each message within the list is represented as a small JSON object specifying the role (such as \"user\") and the actual content of the message (e.g., \"Hello!\"). This setup helps the AI understand the context and the kind of interaction that's taking place. |\n",
    "| configs | JSON | This parameter is a JSON object encompassing a variety of settings you can adjust to customize the video generation process. It includes several sub-parameters, which we will describe next, allowing you to control different aspects of the generation. |\n",
    "| model |  String | Specifies the AI model used for generating the video. There is a \"gemma-7b\" model |\n",
    "| temperature | Float | The temperature setting controls the randomness or diversity of the generation process. A higher temperature value encourages the model to explore a wider range of possibilities, making the output more varied and sometimes more creative. |\n",
    "| top_k |  Integer | This integer value determines the sampling strategy by limiting the selection to the k most likely next tokens at each step of the generation. A lower value of k results in the model focusing more on the higher probability tokens, often leading to more predictable and coherent outcomes. |\n",
    "| top_p |  Float | Similar to top_k, top_p controls the breadth of token selection based on cumulative probability. Setting a lower top_p value means the model will sample from a smaller, more likely set of tokens, which can help in maintaining the relevance and quality of the content generated. |\n",
    "| max_tokens |  Integer | This parameter sets the maximum number of tokens the model can generate. It acts as a cap, ensuring that the generation process does not exceed a certain length, which is crucial for keeping the content focused and within desired constraints. |"
