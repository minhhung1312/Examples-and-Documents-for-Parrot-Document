According to the website, BMI looked at the most recent five years of payouts&nbsp;(2019-2023)&nbsp;and used that as a basis to determine how much each payout should be —&nbsp;after taking into consideration whether the songwriter’s catalog was there for all five years or is still there even if the songwriter has left. Then, it apparently divided songwriters into tiers based on&nbsp;undisclosed parameters and paid every songwriter or publisher in that tier the same amount according to the website. Only songwriters or publishers that had received over $500 in royalties were eligible for a bonus distribution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p\\n\\t\\tclass=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \"\\n>\\n\\tBMI&nbsp;didn’t provide any information on how it calculated allocations other than to say it split the bonus payouts evenly between songwriters and publishers —&nbsp;and that sold catalogs&#8217;&nbsp;bonuses&nbsp;would be pro-rated between the new owners and old owners. But it&nbsp;did disclose that the method it used “is different from how we calculate our quarterly distributions,&#8221; according to the letter signed by BMI president/CEO <strong>Mike O’Neill </strong>that accompanied news of the allocation. “We thought very carefully about how we determined this allocation and made every effort to be as inclusive as possible and have it applied to the greatest number of earning BMI affiliates,” O’Neill’s letter stated. “Your allocation is truly well deserved, and I&#8217;m very pleased to deliver it to you on behalf of BMI&#8217;s former shareholders.

One such catalog, an A-level writer/producer with several No. 1 hits during the period, earned about $4.1 million from BMI over those five years&nbsp;and received a bonus of $47,000 —&nbsp;or a 1.15% bonus on the earnings for the period, according to one source who had access to that data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p\\n\\t\\tclass=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \"\\n>\\n\\tAnother publishing source says comparing songwriters on its rosters&nbsp;who are equally successful to what each received as a bonus created quite a bit of confusion. In one instance,&nbsp;when they&nbsp;compared&nbsp;two songwriters at the same level, both got the same amount&nbsp;even though&nbsp;one has been at BMI for all five years&nbsp;while the other has only been there for only&nbsp;a few of the five years. “BMI might file this under ‘no good deed goes unpunished’ or ‘looking a gift horse in the mouth,’ but so far I can’t see any rhyme or reason on how they are determining the payouts,” that publisher says, but quickly adds, “Having said that, I am very happy for getting the money.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p\\n\\t\\tclass=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \"\\n>\\n\\tA&nbsp;BMI representative was unavailable to comment at deadline — the organization was holding its Trailblazers of Gospel Music Awards event in Atlanta on Thursday.

According to the website, BMI looked at the most recent five years of payouts&nbsp;(2019-2023)&nbsp;and used that as a basis to determine how much each payout should be —&nbsp;after taking into consideration whether the songwriter’s catalog was there for all five years or is still there even if the songwriter has left. Then, it apparently divided songwriters into tiers based on&nbsp;undisclosed parameters and paid every songwriter or publisher in that tier the same amount according to the website.
